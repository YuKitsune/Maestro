# What can it do?
Maestro lets you share music across a variety of different music streaming services with a single link. It achieves this by extracting metadata from the streaming service where the "Share" link came from, then runs a search against a number of other streaming services using that metadata. It then combines the results together, creating a bridge between all of the streaming services.

This is great when sharing music with people who might not use the same music streaming service as you.
